Lighweight docker image for lookbusy


## lookbusy

Lookbusy is a simple application for generating synthetic load on a Linux system. It can generate fixed, predictable loads on CPUs, keep chosen amounts of memory active, and generate disk traffic in any amounts you need.

## Build

```
$ docker build -t lookbusy .
```

## Run

Display usages :

```
$ docker run --rm lookbusy
usage: lookbusy [ -h ] [ options ]
General options:
  -h, --help           Commandline help (you're reading it)
  -v, --verbose        Verbose output (may be repeated)
  -q, --quiet          Be quiet, produce output on errors only
CPU usage options:
  -c, --cpu-util=PCT,  Desired utilization of each CPU, in percent (default
      --cpu-util=RANGE   50%).  If 'curve' CPU usage mode is chosen, a range
                         of the form MIN-MAX should be given.
  -n, --ncpus=NUM      Number of CPUs to keep busy (default: autodetected)
  -r, --cpu-mode=MODE  Utilization mode ('fixed' or 'curve', see lookbusy(1))
  -p, --cpu-curve-peak=TIME
                       Offset of peak utilization within curve period, in
                         seconds (append 'm', 'h', 'd' for other units)
  -P, --cpu-curve-period=TIME
                       Duration of utilization curve period, in seconds (append
		       'm', 'h', 'd' for other units)
Memory usage options:
  -m, --mem-util=SIZE   Amount of memory to use (in bytes, followed by KB, MB,
                         or GB for other units; see lookbusy(1))
  -M, --mem-sleep=TIME Time to sleep between iterations, in usec (default 1000)
Disk usage options:
  -d, --disk-util=SIZE Size of files to use for disk churn (in bytes,
                         followed by KB, MB, GB or TB for other units)
  -b, --disk-block-size=SIZE
                       Size of blocks to use for I/O (in bytes, followed
                         by KB, MB or GB)
  -D, --disk-sleep=TIME
                       Time to sleep between iterations, in msec (default 100)
  -f, --disk-path=PATH Path to a file/directory to use as a buffer (default
                         /tmp); specify multiple times for additional paths
